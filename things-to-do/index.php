    <div id="tab-1">The scenic railroad was rebuilt in 1974 and operates daily, summertime tours from Virginia City to historic Gold Hill and also offers weekend tours on the new extended route from Carson City to Virginia City using century old, ornate, open and closed passenger cars- powered by hard working steam and heritage diesel locomotives. The Virginia & Truckee Railroad is the most famous of all American Short Line railroads. Construction began in 1869 and in the ensuing 74 years the busy mountain railroad hauled millions of dollars in gold and silver ore from the mines deep below Virginia City. As many as 45 trains a day departed from Virginia City for Gold Hill, Silver City, Carson City and Reno where trains such as the 'Lighting Express' connected with the newly constructed transcontinental railroad. The V & T was later extended to Minden, Nevada.

      <br>
      The Foreman-Roberts House Museum is listed on the Historic American Building Survey (HABS) and the National Historic Register. The structure is a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture. In 1873 it was moved to Carson City from Old Washoe City where it was originally located two blocks from the railroad track. Thurman Roberts, the last surviving child of the Roberts family, said it was moved to Carson City on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. The home was moved to Carson City and assembled near one of two artesian wells. The front porch overlooks the State Capital as did many homes and buildings at that time. <a href="http://www.carson.org/index.aspx?page=1093" target="_blank" class="read_more">Read More <span class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></span></a> </div>

Built as the Gold Hill Hotel in 1859, the structure was moved to Cornucopia in 1860 where it was Mrs. Morton's Boarding House, and then back to Tuscarora where it was Mrs. Sweifel's Boarding House, the Woods family residence, the Post Office, telephone switchboard station and the Justice Court building. The Parks bought the house in 1972. A sign that reads, "No Beds Secured Until Paid For" is still hanging in the house. <br>
